Employees were bracing for widespread layoffs at Twitter on Friday, as new owner Elon Musk overhauls the social platform. Twitter has announced a subscription service for $7.99 a month that includes a blue check now given only to verified accounts as new owner Elon Musk works to overhaul the platformâ€™s verification system just ahead of U.S. midterm elections . In an update to Apple iOS devices available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K., Twitter said users who â€œsign up nowâ€� for the new â€œTwitter Blue with verificationâ€� can receive the blue check next to their names â€œjust like the celebrities, companies and politicians you already follow.â€� But Twitter employee Esther Crawford tweeted Saturday that the â€œnew Blue isnâ€™t live yet â€” the sprint to our launch continues but some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time.â€� Verified accounts did not appear to be losing their checks so far. It was not immediately clear when the subscription would go live, and Crawford did not immediately respond to a message to clarify the timing. Twitter also did not immediately respond to a message for comment. Anyone being able to get the blue check could lead to confusion and the rise of disinformation ahead of Tuesday\\'s elections, but Musk tweeted Saturday in response to a question about the risk of impostors impersonating verified people â€” such as politicians and election officials â€” that â€œTwitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money!\\\\\" â€œSo if scammers want to do this a million times, thatâ€™s just a whole bunch of free money,\\\\\" he said. But many fear widespread layoffs that began Friday could gut the guardrails of content moderation and verification on the social platform that public agencies, election boards, police departments and news outlets use to keep people reliably informed. The change will represent the end of Twitterâ€™s current verification system , which was launched in 2009 to prevent impersonations of high-profile accounts such as celebrities and politicians. Before the planned overhaul, Twitter had about 423,000 verified accounts, many of them rank-and-file journalists from around the globe that the company verified regardless of how many followers they had. Experts have raised grave concerns about upending the platformâ€™s verification system that, while not perfect, has helped Twitterâ€™s 238 million daily users determine whether the accounts they were getting information from were authentic . Current verified accounts include celebrities, athletes, influencers and other high-profile public figures, along with government agencies and politicians worldwide, journalists and news outlets, activists and businesses and brands, and Musk himself. â€œHe knows the blue check has value, and heâ€™s trying to exploit it quickly,â€� said Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor of communications at Syracuse University and an expert on social media. â€œHe needs to earn the trust of the people before he can sell them anything. Why would you buy a car from a salesman that you know has essentially proved to be chaotic?â€� The update Twitter made to the iOS version of its app does not mention verification as part of the new blue check system. So far, the update is not available on Android devices. Musk, who had earlier said that he wants to â€œverify all humansâ€� on Twitter, has floated that public figures would be identified in ways other than the blue check. Currently, for instance, government officials are identified with text under names stating that they are posting from an official government account. President Joe Bidenâ€™s @POTUS account, for example, says in gray letters it belongs to an â€œUnited States government official.â€� The change comes a day after Twitter began laying off workers to cut costs and as more companies are pausing advertising on the platform as a cautious corporate world waits to see how it will operate under its new owner. About half of the companyâ€™s staff of 7,500 was let go, tweeted Yoel Roth, Twitterâ€™s head of safety and integrity. He said the companyâ€™s front-line content moderation staff was the group the least affected by the job cuts and that â€œefforts on election integrity â€” including harmful misinformation that can suppress the vote and combatting state-backed information operations â€” remain a top priority.â€� Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on Saturday took blame for the widespread job losses. He had two runs as CEO of Twitter, with the most recent stretching from 2015 into 2021. â€œI own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly,â€� he tweeted. â€œI apologize for that.â€� Musk tweeted late Friday that there was no choice but to cut jobs â€œwhen the company is losing over $4M/day.â€� He did not provide details on the daily losses at Twitter and said employees who lost their jobs were offered three monthsâ€™ pay as a severance. Meanwhile, Twitter has already seen â€œa massive drop in revenueâ€� because of pressure from activist groups on advertisers to get off the platform, Musk tweeted Friday. That hits Twitter hard because of its heavy reliance so far on advertising to make money. During the first six months of this year, nearly $92 of every $100 it made in revenue came from advertising. United Airlines on Saturday became the latest major brand to pause advertising on Twitter, confirming the move but declining to discuss the reasons for it or what it would need to see to resume advertising on the platform. It joined the growing list of big companies pausing ads on Twitter, including General Motors, REI, General Mills and Audi. Musk tried to reassure advertisers last week, saying Twitter would not become a â€œfree-for-all hellscapeâ€� because of what he calls his commitment to free speech. But concerns remain about whether a lighter touch on content moderation at Twitter will result in users sending out more offensive tweets. That could hurt companiesâ€™ brands if their advertisements appear next to them.\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-05 22:12:00\",\"image_url\":\"https://www.castanet.net/content/2022/11/20221105161140-6366ca50821cf083b81e9d15jpeg_p3633678.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"castanet\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Twitter Rolls Out Blue Checkmarks for Paying Customers\",\"link\":\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-rolls-out-blue-check-marks-for-paying-customers-11667681496?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f\",\"keywords\":null,\"creator\":null,\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"Twitter Inc. said it has begun rolling out software updates to charge users $7.99 a month to mark their accounts with a blue checkmark, part of Elon Muskâ€™s early efforts to boost revenue a little more than a week after taking ownership of the social-media network.\",\"content\":null,\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-05 21:52:00\",\"image_url\":\"https://images.wsj.net/im-659702/medium\",\"source_id\":\"wsj\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Twitter founder apologizes amid Muskâ€™s mass layoffs: â€˜I own the responsibilityâ€™ - The Hill\",\"link\":\"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vcG9saWN5L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMzcyMTQ5Ny10d2l0dGVyLWZvdW5kZXItYXBvbG9naXplcy1hbWlkLW11c2tzLW1hc3MtbGF5b2Zmcy1pLW93bi10aGUtcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5\",\"keywords\":null,\"creator\":null,\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"Twitter founder apologizes amid Muskâ€™s mass layoffs: â€˜I own the responsibilityâ€™Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The HillTwitter founder Jack Dorsey apologizes after Elon Musk lays off staffÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0CNNElon Musk says what\\'s next for Twitter advertisers if they bow to activists demands and leave the platformÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Fox BusinessTwitter needs to change, so letâ€™s give Musk a chanceÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0The HillJack Dorsey tweets apology and takes responsibility for mass layoffs at Twitter under Elon MuskÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Yahoo!

Nov 5, 2022, 04:27pm EDT | Updated Nov 5, 2022, 04:47pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Twitter followed through on CEO Elon Muskâ€™s pledge just days earlier to launch new features to its Twitter Blue subscription model Saturday, rolling out a $7.99 per month charge to receive a blue checkmark for new features as Musk scrambles to find ways to generate more revenueâ€”but it was a bumpy release, with a Twitter manager conceding they were still â€œworking and testing in real-time.â€� Twitter launched its $8 Twitter Blue subscription model Saturday. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts A blue checkmark, which had previously been reserved for verified accounts primarily held by celebrities, politicians, companies and news outlets, now comes with â€œhalf the adsâ€� and â€œmuch better ones,â€� according to a Twitter statement released Saturday. Twitter users with $8 a month blue checkmarks will also be able to post longer videos and have their content prioritized in replies, mentions and searches. The launch comes four days after Musk announced the plan, tweeting the platformâ€™s â€œcurrent lords & peasants system for who has or doesnâ€™t have a blue checkmark is bulls**t.â€� Roughly 300,000 of Twitterâ€™s reported 237.8 million users have a blue-check verification, according to Bloomberg â€”and those accounts will need to pay the $8 monthly fee to retain their blue-check status, with many saying theyâ€™re not likely to pay it. Chief Critic After the announcement, however, several users complained the new features hadnâ€™t materialized, suggesting the process was not entirely ready to be rolled out. One complaint prompted a response from Esther Crawford, Twitter director of product management, who wrote , â€œyouâ€™re catching us working and testing in real-time. . . but the new version and all accompanying features arenâ€™t live yet â€¦ itâ€™ll all be coming soon!â€� What We Donâ€™t Know Whether Musk will raise the price of Twitter Blue subscriptions. Twitter said it would cost $7.99 per month â€œif you sign up now,â€� potentially indicating there could be a future price hike for the feature. Earlier reports suggested Musk could charge as much as $20 a month, although he walked back on that number when horror author Stephen King tweeted at him, saying Twitter â€œshould pay me.â€� Musk replied, â€œWe need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?â€� Big Number $13 billion. Thatâ€™s how much several major banks, including Bank of America, Barclays Plc and Morgan Stanley, are reportedly providing Musk in financing for his $44 billion acquisition, which he completed late last month. Forbes , however, estimates it would take 10.4 million users paying for Twitter Blue each year to cover the debt. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates the $8 fees could generate roughly 4-5% (between $230 million and $290 million) of what the company makes in advertising revenue, â€œif adoption is strong,â€� Forbes reported. When asked if it could generate $1 billion, Ives replied, â€œnope.â€� Key Background Twitter unveiled the Twitter Blue subscription program last year as a separate service from its verification model, charging $4.99 a month and giving users the ability to undo tweets, while providing them a customizable navigation bar and prioritized customer support. Its verification model, meanwhile, has been kept to accounts deemed â€œauthentic, notable and active.â€� The platform suspended the verification program in 2017 after coming under scrutiny over several accounts that violated the companyâ€™s policies despite receiving blue checkmarks. Twitter lifted its suspension on the program last July. Tangent Speaking at a Baron Investment Conference Friday, Musk acknowledged he attempted to renege on his $44 billion offer since he initially announced it in April, admitting the company was experiencing â€œpretty serious revenue challenges and cost challenges,â€� before the acquisition, and faces a new challenge as advertisers pull the plug on ads. Advertisers have started pulling ads off the site over the past week, with big-name companies including Audi, GM, Pfizer, General Mills, United Airlines and Volkswagen all announcing they are pausing their advertising , as fears grow that Musk could open the floodgates for hate speech and conspiracy theories to proliferate by loosening Twitterâ€™s moderation.A group of organizations urged Twitterâ€™s top 20 advertisers to â€œcease all advertisingâ€� if Musk lifts its moderation policies. NAACP President Derrick Johnson also pleaded with advertisers to suspend advertising, arguing itâ€™s â€œimmoral, dangerous and highly destructive to our democracyâ€� for a company to fund a site that â€œfuels hate speech, election denialism and conspiracy theories.â€� Musk had been attempting for weeks to persuade advertisers not to leave the site, pledging in an open letter last week not to let the platform descend into a â€œfree-for-all hellscapeâ€� without consequences. On Friday, Musk posted a tweet blaming â€œactivist groupsâ€� for pressuring advertisers to pull ads, arguing they are â€œtrying to destroy free speech in America,â€� and that he has not done anything to change the companyâ€™s moderation policies.

Several of Twitter\\'s top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, were also fired after Musk took control. Musk is considering adding a fee for accounts with the blue verification badge. The new strategy, he said, would give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators. Opponents of the approach say it will make it easier for users to spread disinformation or to impersonate someone else on Twitter. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mocked the idea of Musk charging user fees. Many worry that overhauling Twitter will lead to an explosion of hate speech and spam on the platform. Under Musk\\'s ownership, Twitter has seen a significant spike in hate speech , according to a new study. Researchers from Montclair State University found that the 12 hours immediately following Musk\\'s ascension to ownership saw a much more \\\\\"hostile\\\\\" environment on Twitter. \\\\\"These issues aren\\'t new, and the people targeted by hateful conduct aren\\'t numbers or data points. We\\'re going to continue investing in policy and technology to make things better,\\\\\" Yoel Roth, Twitter\\'s head of safety and security, tweeted on Monday. Musk has not explicitly said what will be tolerated on the platform since the surge began, although he retweeted Roth\\'s statements about the surge. Last week, Musk said that Twitter will form a \\\\\"content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints\\\\\" and that no major content decisions would be made before that council can convene. \\\\\"Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks,\\\\\" Musk said Tuesday night. \\\\\"Twitter\\'s content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views, which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence.\\\\\" Trending News Jack Dorsey apologizes to Twitter employees after thousands laid off Handyman pleads guilty to killing of mother found dismembered in duffel bag 38 people injured in fire on 20th floor of New York City apartment building Stimulus, CTC funds: Got a letter from the IRS?

Now sheâ€™s afraid it could all fall apart if Twitter becomes a haven for racist and toxic speech under the control of Elon Musk, who has indicated he could loosen content rules. With Twitter driving most of her business, Chandler sees no good alternative as she watches the uncertainty play out. â€œBefore Elon took over, I felt like the team was working to make Twitter a safer platform, and now they are kind of not there. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on internally. I have lost hope in that,â€� said Chandler, 31, founder of Black Tech Pipeline, a jobs board and recruitment website. â€œIâ€™m both sad and terrified for Twitter, both for the employees and also the users.â€� Those qualms are weighing on many people who have come to rely on Twitter, a relatively small but mighty platform that has become a digital public square of sorts for influencers, policy makers, journalists and other thought leaders. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, took over Twitter last week in a $44 billion deal, immediately making his unpredictable style felt. Just days later, he had tweeted a link to a story from a little-known news outlet that made a dubious claim about the violent attack on Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosiâ€™s husband at their California home. He soon deleted it, but it was a worrying start to his tenure for those concerned about the spread of disinformation online. FILE â€“ Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition on March 9, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) Musk has also signaled his intent to loosen the guardrails on hate speech, and perhaps allow former President Donald Trump and other banned commentators to return. He tempered the thought after the deal closed, however, pledging to form a â€œcontent moderation councilâ€� and not allow anyone who has been kicked off the site to return until it sets up procedures on how to do that. Yet the use of racial slurs quickly exploded in an apparent test of his tolerance level. â€œFolks, itâ€™s getting ugly here. I am not really sure what my plan is. Stay or go?â€� Jennifer Taub, a law professor and author with about a quarter million followers, said Sunday, as she tweeted out a link to her Facebook page in case she leaves Twitter. For now, Taub plans to stay, given the opportunity it provides to â€œlaugh, learn and commiserateâ€� with people from across the world. But sheâ€™ll leave if it becomes â€œa cesspool of racism and antisemitism,â€� she said in a phone call. â€œThe numbers are going down and down and down,â€� said Taub, who has lost 5,000 followers since Musk officially took over. â€œThe tipping point might be if Iâ€™m just not having fun there. There are too many people to block.â€� The debate is especially fraught for people of color who have used Twitter to network and elevate their voices, while also confronting toxicity on the platform. â€œAs a user of Twitter â€” as a power user in a lot of ways â€” it has had a great utility and Iâ€™m very concerned about where people go to have this conversation next,â€� said Tanzina Vega, a Latina journalist in New York who once received death threats on Twitter but also built a vital community of friends and sources there. A software engineer, Chandler hoped to counter the isolation she felt in her white-dominated field when she tweeted out a question and a selfie four years ago: â€œWhat does a Black Twitter in Tech look like? Here, Iâ€™ll go first!â€� The response was overwhelming. She now has more than 60,000 followers and her own company connecting Black tech workers with companies large and small. She also received hate message and even some death threats from people accusing her of racism for centering Black technologists. But she also had connections with Twitter employees who were receptive to her concerns. Chandler said those employees have either left the company or are no longer active on the platform. Chandlerâ€™s company also uses Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn but none can replicate the type of vibrant community she leads on Twitter, where people mix professional networking and light bantering. Instagram and TikTok are fueled more by images than text exchanges. Facebook is no longer popular with younger users. LinkedIn is more formal. And although some developers are trying to rush out alternative sites on the fly, it takes times to develop a stable, user-friendly site that can handle millions of accounts. The Twitter logo is seen on a smartphone. UNSPLASH Joan Donovan, an internet scholar who explores the threat that disinformation poses to democracy in her new book, â€œMeme Wars,â€� said itâ€™s not clear if Twitter will remain a safe place for civic discourse. Yet she called the networks that people have built there invaluable â€” to users, to their communities and to Musk. â€œThis is the exact reason that Musk bought Twitter and didnâ€™t just build his own social network,â€� Donovan said. â€œIf you control the territory, you can control the politics, you can control the culture in many ways.â€� In his first few hours at the helm, Musk fired several top Twitter executives, including chief legal counsel Vijaya Gadde, who had overseen Twitterâ€™s content moderation and safety efforts around the globe. And he dissolved the board of directors, leaving him accountable, at least on paper, only to himself. On Friday, Twitter began widespread layoffs. European regulators immediately warned Musk about his duty under their digital privacy laws to police illegal speech and disinformation. The U.S. has far more lax rules governing Twitter and its 238 million daily users. But advertisers, users and perhaps lenders may rein him in if Congress does not first tighten the rules. â€œIf the advertisers go and the users go, it may well be that the marketplace of ideas sort of sorts itself out,â€� said Cary Coglianese, an expert on regulatory policy at the University of Pennsylvania law school. That could leave Twitter to be just another magnet for extremists and conspiracy theorists â€” a concern driving some to urge their network of friends to stay, in order to counter those narratives. Chandler said she can only â€œwalk on eggshellsâ€� and take a wait-and-see approach. â€œIâ€™m personally going to stay on Twitter until there is really not a reason to stay anymore. I donâ€™t know what the future holds, Iâ€™m kind of hoping for some sort of miracle,â€� she said. â€œFor now, I wonâ€™t be going anywhere.â€�\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-05 14:08:15\",\"image_url\":\"https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2022/11/2022110510114-63666e3b821cf083b81e893ajpeg.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"citynews1130\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Elon Muskâ€™s Twitter Takeover Follows the Inception of TWTZER!\",\"link\":\"https://ripplecoinnews.com/elon-musks-twitter-takeover-follows-the-inception-of-twtzer/\",\"keywords\":[\"Crypto and Blockchain News\"],\"creator\":[\"Gracie Perez\"],\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire has acquired the position of Twitterâ€™s chief executive after scoring the firm in a $44bn (Â£39.3bn) deal back on October 27.

He eliminated around 3,700 jobs on the social media platform which is calculated worth half of its workforce. Some news reports state that this layout is done without enough notice beforehand in violation of federal and California law. According to the ex-employees, no provident notice was ensured under US federal law over job losses. Now, Twitter is confronting a class action lawsuit from former employees who had lost their jobs. They came to know about this kick-off when they were exempted from their work accounts on Thursday. As Usual Humorous Reply Also, Elon Musk exclusively made an announcement a day later with a tweet saying â€œthe bird is freedâ€�. Soon after this statement, Twitter was crowded with many discussions, tweets, and talks about the careless decision made. Later, the director of product management at Twitter [Crawford] replied on a Twitter thread saying â€œWhen your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWorkâ€�. Of couse, after this dramatic coup of the micro-blogging site, the internet is stuffed with talks about the companyâ€™s future and working style. As per the reliable news agency, an email has already been shot out to the employees briefing them about the leaving process, the temporary closure of offices, and restricting staff access. This has engrossed uncertainty about the employees and upcoming tenure under Mr. Musk. Meanwhile, amid this dismissal news, Musk expressed his views on â€œtiny talkâ€�. Despite the curiosity in the air, some users are pounding him for carrying the sudden mass layoffs. The billionaire has hitherto fired top management work employees including Twitter ex-legal head Vijaya Gadde and ex-CEO Parag Agrawal. The notice says that the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act moderates conglomerate firms to mount mass layoffs without giving at least 60 days of prior notice. In fact, the lawsuit requests the court to circulate an order entailing Twitter to accept and follow the WARN Act. This will keep the company under control from soliciting employees to immediately sign documents that could despair their right to join the litigation. Past Claims Remind of Muskâ€™s Current Actions This event reminds me of Liss-Riordan suing Tesla Inc. over a similar allegation in June. This incident occurred when Musk directed an electric-car maker to lay off around 10% of its workforce. Instead, Tesla secured a ruling hand from a federal judge in Austin pressuring the workers to chase their claims in closed-door arbitration rather than in an open court. Elon Musk expressed this Tesla lawsuit as â€œtrivialâ€� while mentioning it with John Micklethwait [Editor-In-Chief at Bloomberg] back in June. Elon Musk is now actually known for his humorous replies as he recently responded to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez â€“ an American politician mocking Musk to charge $8 for blue tick. He then took it out saying â€œYour feedback is appreciated, now pay $8â€� and instantly posted a screenshot of her website imposing $58 pointing out that Musk is charging way much less than Cortez. Twtzer Is a New Social Media Talk The talks have motivated some more organisations to come up with an idea to ease the difficult times. It is said that the implementation of the Internetâ€™s next version will endeavor its fundamentals in the Blockchain and ongoing cryptocurrency space. While scrolling, I would like to share a decentralized operating model sharing some vital points of view as Twitter. However, this cannot be considered way too simple being the next playground of VC structures. All such upcoming social media applications are registered under the umbrella term â€œWeb3 metaverseâ€� which is trending its way out. You can navigate through this information about a new version of social media following the successful footsteps of Twitter- TWTZER. The team has just announced the imminent inauguration of the beta version of the social network â€œTWTZERâ€�. This application is designed to overcome the existing complexities and forthcoming unfair problems in centralized social media. To briefly talk about Twtzer- it is a blockchain-operating social networking project, building a twitter-like social network entirely decentralized, unbiased, and accessible to everyone free of cost. The application is secured by utmost blockchain security layers, tackled adroitly on smart contracts, and designed to serve fair freedom. The Twtzer app will be initially available for Desktop, iOS, and Android. This application will enable users to freely post content with consent, properly engage with the audience, strengthen their profile by getting â€œ a Dark Blue tick â€œ , link wallet for instant real-time transactions, and provide Ads with additional services to organisations. Whatâ€™s Interesting is ! The IPO of Twtzer on Wed 9th Nov The project whitepaper tells about the distribution of 49% of equity in an IPO program. So, you can try this new platform, reserve TWTZ tokens offered by the entire ecosystem, and earn dividends for Lifetime. The Presale will run for 25 Days or after closing the Hardcap As of now, Twtzer will host a crowdfunding event where 49% of the total shares are allocated to the overall audience. The rest of the shares are kept aside for liquidity, development, team and locking of the protocolâ€™s purposes. The initial buyers or holders of TWTZ assets will have the opportunity to reserve lifetime shares and acquire dividends of application revenue. You can surely give it a try as this seems the next social media booster after Twitterâ€™s rolling news.

In fact, most of this article will be about what has been happening on and at Twitter lately. I think there are a few big impacts that could hit Tesla as a result, and then various ramifications from those if they do occur. Skip down to the bottom if you want to avoid the Twitter dumpster fire and only think about the effects on Tesla. Elon Muskâ€™s Twitter Purchase The actual series of events that led to Elon Musk deciding to buy a big stake of Twitter and get on its board, which then quickly evolved into buying Twitter and taking it private, is fascinating and you might even say bizarre, but Iâ€™ll leave that for the comments under the article if anyone is interested. The very short story, though, is that Elon thinks â€œfree speechâ€� wasnâ€™t given free reign on Twitter previously, and it is his multi-billion-dollar contribution to human society (just not places like China and Saudi Arabia, of course) to bring â€œfree speechâ€� to Twitter. Many believe that free speech was doing fine on Twitter, and it was just hate speech that was heavily moderated, but I think it is correct to assume that a big bulk of Elonâ€™s rationale for buying Twitter was this â€œfree speechâ€� issue. Just note that Twitter is a private-company platform (hence Elonâ€™s ability to buy it) and that it is not even close to the largest social media platform, so itâ€™s hard to genuinely equate it to a hypothetical â€œglobal town square.â€� On the other hand, it has been the chosen platform for government announcements, much political â€œdiscussion,â€� and news reporters. pic.twitter.com/Srvx74rKo7 â€” Nafnlaus ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ (@enn_nafnlaus) November 3, 2022 After Elon negotiated a proposal with Twitter to buy Twitter, he got cold feet. He claims that the reason for that was that Twitterâ€™s estimate for how many accounts were bots/fake spam accounts was far too low, and thus he was misled. Unfortunately for Elon, he had waived due diligence in an initial effort or plan to close the deal quickly and he was in no position to wiggle out of the deal. He went to court with Twitter for a while, but his prospects of winning in court looked quite bad, and in the end, he agreed to buy Twitter more or less as was agreed in the original proposal months ago. If Iâ€™ve got this right, Twitter made about $600 million in revenue last year. Not even looking at other costs, thatâ€™s reportedly far less than the expected interest on debt put on Twitter in this deal. â€œTo finance his Twitter deal, he loaded the company with $13 billion in debt, putting it on the hook to pay more than $1 billion annually in interest alone,â€� the New York Times writes. If youâ€™re seeing a problem here, youâ€™re not the only one. What Is Happening On Twitter Now? Leading up to the Twitter deal, in the course of negotiating the Twitter deal, and since acquiring Twitter, Elon has made a series of quite antagonistic, inflammatory, and conspiracy-laden tweets. (One would think that someone who has so many self-inflicted wounds from tweeting would be a bit more cautious about taking over the platform and while doing so, but alas, that is not what fate had in mind.) This is by no means an exhaustive list, but Iâ€™m going to highlight a few that are very relevant at the moment. His own reminder of his tweet to open 2022 is probably the best place to start, though: As I was saying â€¦ pic.twitter.com/tsGz6fCWuW â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 2, 2022 Indeed, flicking a tigerâ€™s nuts leads to a wild situation. While that was a joke, and then was a joking reminder of the joke in May, it seems that Elonâ€™s game plan lately has been to flick the tigerâ€™s nuts at least once a day. Itâ€™s not been going especially well for him or Twitter as a result. Going back to the idea of â€œfree speech,â€� as I understand it, what has actually been heavily moderated on Twitter (though, not nearly enough in many peopleâ€™s eyes) is hate speech and dangerous speech. You may recall that some portion of the Republican Party tried to overthrow the US government and stop the transfer of power after a presidential election for the first time in history on January 6, 2020. You may know that many minorities are hated, targeted for harassment, and brutally harmed and murdered in countless cases. Twitter moderation has presumably been in large part trying to prevent political violence and violence toward minorities. Elon and many others on the right believe that such moderation has gone too far, and he indicated on multiple occasions that once he took over Twitter, heâ€™d lay off a huge portion of Twitterâ€™s content moderation team. Companies that advertise on Twitter, however, have seen that as particularly risky to their brands and the wrong path to take. And the more nuanced take on â€œfree speechâ€� is that while speech is free in a democratic society, it also comes with responsibilities and hate speech and very dangerous speech are not permitted. As one saying goes, â€œyour freedom ends where it blocks another personâ€™s basic freedom.â€� The most famous example is that you are nor permitted to shout â€œFIREâ€� in a crowded theater if there isnâ€™t a fire, because it can lead to people rushing out of the theater and hurting if not killing each other in the stampede. (Relevant side note: one of the â€œdonâ€™t tread on meâ€� Oathkeepers who died on January 6 died from the stampede â€” she was literally tread on to the point that she died.) In the midst of all this uncertainty and controversy, after Paul Pelosi was attacked last weak, Elon engaged in some â€¦ very questionable tweeting. Background: Nancy Pelosi is currently 3rd in line to run the United States , only behind President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Someone believing various right-wing conspiracies broke into her home with the intent to kidnap and torture her, and perhaps assassinate her. Not being home, the person attacked her husband, bludgeoning him in the skull with a hammer. Somehow, Elon was sent a conspiracy story that the attacker was actually Paul Pelosiâ€™s gay lover. The website the story was published on once claimed in 2016 that Hillary Clinton was dead and it was actually her body double who debated Donald Trump. Ironically, Elonâ€™s tweet about the Paul Pelosi conspiracy theory was in response to a tweet by Hillary Clinton. (What are the chances?) Needless to say, in the midst of concerns about hate speech running wild, conspiracy theories running wild, and a rather unpredictable Elon Musk running the Twitter show in who knows what way, advertisers decided to put their Twitter advertising on pause and see what happens before jumping back in. With a large portion of advertising money drying up, Twitter and Elon are in a bit of a bind, or a crisis perhaps. Since we are talking Twitter, here are a handful of insightful, clever, and humorous tweets to bring us to this point (aside from the two from Elon referencing the flicking of a tigerâ€™s balls): Advertisers are not being manipulated by activist groups, they are being compelled by established principles around the types of companies they can do business with. These principles include an assessment of the platforms commitment to brand safety and suitability. â€” Lou Paskalis ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ (@LouPas) November 4, 2022 Sir, has your strategy of assuring MAGA leaders you are going to turn this platform into a MAGA Hellscape, firing key people in content moderation, and generally acting erratic not worked to assure advertisers this is a safe place to sell their goods & services? â€” David Rothschild ğŸŒ» (@DavMicRot) November 4, 2022 Elon be like pic.twitter.com/Z77AYfuC4e â€” MD (@mikeydoubled) November 4, 2022 CNN just reported that they spoke with Twitter advertisers, and the reason theyâ€™ve pulled their ads is because of Elon Muskâ€™s own behavior since acquiring Twitter, including his tweet sharing a homophobic conspiracy theory about the brutal attack on Mr. Pelosi. https://t.co/5Uwev1nX48 â€” John Aravosis ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡·ğŸ�³ï¸�â€�ğŸŒˆ (@aravosis) November 4, 2022 In hindsight, tweeting that there was â€œa small chanceâ€� Paul Pelosiâ€™s attacker could have been his secret gay lover was not the most advertiser friendly move. â€” Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog) November 4, 2022 If only someone, apart from ***basically everyone***, had warned you that your habit of spreading conspiracy theories, divisive political rhetoric, and plans to weaken anti-harassment rules in the name of \\\\\"free speech\\\\\", would scare off advertisers. â€” Nafnlaus ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ (@enn_nafnlaus) November 4, 2022 Iâ€™m dying ğŸ¤£â€¦Elon hit with a fact check by the app he just dropped $44B on pic.twitter.com/eBgalvTdVa â€” Wu-Tang is for the Children (@WUTangKids) November 4, 2022 Maybe you need to apologize publicly for posting that vile conspiracy theory instead of just deleting and not addressing it.

On to the next portion of the dumpster fire. $8/month, please! I an apparent effort to make Twitter financially fit, Elon Musk pitched the idea of a $20/month fee for a verified blue checkmark on Twitter. In response to protest from the famous author and Tesla Model S owner Stephen King, Elon dropped the price to $8. Nonetheless, many have highlighted the absurdity of going from â€œthis is all about free speechâ€� to â€œyour tweets will get more attention/be prioritized over others if you pay $8/monthâ€� (not direct quotes). Additionally, many have criticized, scoffed at, and tried to explain the problems with charging $8/month for verified blue checkmarks. Here are some tweets: Just to make this as clear as possible. What verification means now: We\\'ve confirmed this person or company is who they say they are. What verification will mean in the future: I have $8. Elon could still back out of this, but that\\'s the fundamental change that he\\'s proposing. â€” Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) November 4, 2022 The Twitter checkmark isnâ€™t a status symbol. Itâ€™s much more useful than that. It allows you to quickly check whether someone is the real deal and not an impersonator. This improves Twitter overall, and impedes bad actors. So it should be free and universal, not a paid perk. â€” Walt Mossberg (@waltmossberg) November 3, 2022 A free blue check that is earned has value. A blue check that any scammer can buy has no value, at any price. Elon hasn\\'t figured out the difference between price and value. â€” 2001st mule â™¨ï¸� (@Jeb2028) November 3, 2022 I just can\\'t get over the pivot from \\\\\"free speech/town square\\\\\" to \\\\\"$8 per month.\\\\\" Pretty breathtaking. â€” Joseph (@jhkayejr) November 4, 2022 pic.twitter.com/aze1FUytTM â€” Marja ğŸ’™ ğŸŒ�â˜¯ï¸�â˜® (@marjaane) November 3, 2022 Verification is a public service, it is a good deed performed by companies who contribute very little good to the world in my opinion.

Remember that next time you question yourself or your qualifications. â€” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 3, 2022 You get the point â€” there are a lot of reasons why $8/month for a blue checkmark verification on Twitter is not a great idea. Risks for Tesla With that looooooooong bit of background out of the way (and thatâ€™s not even half of it), letâ€™s get to how this could be affecting Tesla. Elon Musk is the face of Tesla. More than perhaps any other CEO, the two are tied in a knot in the public eye. For a long time, that was a great benefit to Tesla, because Elon would give Q&A sessions in which he focused on noble and widely loved ideas like protecting humanity, having fun, exploring the cutting edge of tech and space, solving climate change, and being a good human. This whole Twitter saga, as well as a few controversies before it, have made Elon more and more of a controversial figure. To put it bluntly, heâ€™s seen in a much worse light nowadays than he was for years. Here are three good summary tweets on this matter, one from the famous music producer Moby: In 2013, @elonmusk came and spoke to us at the first Tesla conference in California. He made us all have hope for the future again. He was a true inspiration and a joy to see and hear from. Not sure what happened to change him. I hope he will see that Tesla lovers miss him. â€” (((Mother Earth))) (@G8trz4ever) October 29, 2022 Dear @elonmusk as a former friend may I suggest that dealing with climate change and protecting democracy might be a better use of time and money than giving racists and antisemites a social media platform â€” moby Xâ“‹X (@thelittleidiot) October 28, 2022 In general, many just want to see Elon focusing on positive stuff again, and contributing to optimistic solutions, not misguided grievance politics. As long as heâ€™s doing the latter, it is quite likely he is damaging Teslaâ€™s brand and future sales. So, the first issue for Tesla with all of this, is that it could genuinely hurt Teslaâ€™s brand and demand for Tesla vehicles, solar panels, and energy storage units. Also, increasingly latching onto crazy conspiracy theories and faulty logic, people are questioning more and more whether he is logical and trustworthy as the head of Tesla. Thatâ€™s not to say that he hasnâ€™t done a superb â€” historic â€” job leading Tesla to the tremendous heights it has risen to, but these kinds of errors, logical fallacies, bad business ideas (see: $8/mo Twitter), and susceptibility to debunked and obviously false conspiracy theories are creating serious cracks in Elonâ€™s reputation and even superfansâ€™ faith in his leadership at Tesla. In particular, those concerned about the Tesla stock price have been speaking out more than Iâ€™ve ever seen. Some examples: I donâ€™t care whether heâ€™s left or right, and I donâ€™t need to agree with his opinions, but when he tweets unsubstantiated conspiracy theories from low quality dubious sources, it looks like the beginning of a hairline crack in his logic and to reason whatâ€™s ground truth vs BS. â€” Scott Wainner (@scottwww) October 30, 2022 Thatâ€™s exactly the problem Iâ€™ve been seeing. Heâ€™s a freaking genius but everyone can have blind spots and be influenced in a negative way by people around them. 15 or so years ago I was falling into the conspiracy trap too due to mistrust of media. So glad I didnâ€™t go too deep. â€” Cybertruck + Aptera ğŸ’š (@TeslaTruckClub) October 30, 2022 None of this means I don\\'t love Elon, Tesla, SpaceX and the rest. That hasn\\'t changed. Just really feeling let down lately. Oh, and fuck the fuck your feelings folks. I invested more on feelings and my love of the above than any spreadsheets or financial data. â€” Techgnostik ğŸ«¶ (@Techgnostik) October 31, 2022 That\\'s the problem. The trend is towards more and more mistakes. And he rarely comes back and addresses them, apologizes, or explains. He just deletes and tries to move on. But the damage doesn\\'t move on. â€” Techgnostik ğŸ«¶ (@Techgnostik) October 30, 2022 Investors should at least consider that Elonâ€™s twitter ownership might be a drag on the mission of Tesla and SpaceX. Too soon to tell and Elon tends to beat the odds. What do you think? (No plans to sellâ€¦regardless) â€” ğŸ�¶ Earl of FrunkPuppy ğŸ�¶ (@28delayslater) October 31, 2022 The worst part of @elonmusk tweeting dumb conspiracy BS is that heâ€™s been the target of dumb conspiracy BS for years from TSLAQ (and others), so youâ€™d think he would not even consider sharing dumb conspiracy BS. â€” Cybertruck + Aptera ğŸ’š (@TeslaTruckClub) October 31, 2022 Our fellow Musk and Tesla supporters are not doing Elon a favor by just coming up with reasons. Thing is I believe they are doing for stock price, and the excusing is doing the apposite. â€” KeithWontEverVoteForInsurrectionistParty (@KeithInKeyWest) October 31, 2022 Given that the richest man in the world had the worst possible timing in buying Twitter, waived due diligence, then spent months trying to back out of it with a transparent excuse, and failed and paid full price, I think he could use all the advice about Twitter he can get. :Ã� â€” Nafnlaus ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ (@enn_nafnlaus) November 2, 2022 So, aside from Tesla taking a hit in actual sales (potentially), thereâ€™s a risk for shareholders that the companyâ€™s stock will take a hit. Thereâ€™s stockholder risk beyond this perception factor, too. Elon had to sell Tesla stock to buy Twitter, but he also reportedly took out a lot of debt based on his Tesla stock in order to finance the deal, and if Teslaâ€™s stock price drops a lot, he could face an issue with the banks and have to sell more stock. Furthermore, if Twitter canâ€™t get its own finances in order, itâ€™s possible that Elon will have to sell even more stock down the line to help out the company. All of this results in quite a lot more Tesla stockholder risk than existed a few months ago. Investors donâ€™t like risk. The result could play out in quite an unpleasant way for shareholders in the coming months/years. ( Disclosure: I own shares of TSLA. ) Last but perhaps not least, all of the time and attention Elon is putting into Twitter is time and attention that he canâ€™t put into Tesla. This was a concern from the beginning among people who think his time solving problems at Tesla is critical to the companyâ€™s continued innovation and success. Itâ€™s also odd, confusing, or at least hypocritical that Elon said multiple times that he couldnâ€™t work on new tech that could go under Teslaâ€™s umbrella because his brain was full, he was too busy, and other things along those lines. Hereâ€™s a reminder of a couple of big ones: Elon: I canâ€™t do home HVACs and e-planes because my brain is full. Buys Twitter â€” Doggiewumpus (@Doggie_wumpus) October 31, 2022 At least a few times, Elon has said that heâ€™d love to work on electric aircraft or improved HVAC for homes, but he is just too busy. But not too busy for a growing Twitter dumpster fire? ( Note: Elon and Tesla cofounder and longtime CTO JB Straubel initially met over lunch to discuss their joint interest in developing electric aircraft. That lunch led to the Tesla we know today. ) Love To All To close, after all of that trauma, letâ€™s remember that tools like Twitter can be used for good. If only we all used Twitter more like Michael Caine does: Love to all â€” Michael Caine (@themichaelcaine) November 3, 2022 Side note: it sure is nice knowing that is genuinely Michael Caine, thanks to the blue verification checkmark.

Employees are bracing for widespread layoffs at Twitter as Musk overhauls the social platform. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) UPDATE 6:45 p.m. Twitter began widespread layoffs Friday as new owner Elon Musk overhauls the company, raising grave concerns about chaos enveloping the social media platform and its ability to fight disinformation just days ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. The speed and size of the cuts also opened Musk and Twitter to lawsuits. At least one was filed alleging Twitter violated federal law by not providing fired employees the required notice. The San Francisco-based company told workers by email Thursday that they would learn Friday if they had been laid off. About half of the companyâ€™s staff of 7,500 was let go, Yoel Roth, Twitterâ€™s head of safety & integrity, confirmed in a tweet. Musk tweeted late Friday that there was no choice but to cut the jobs â€œwhen the company is losing over $4M/day.\\\\\" He did not provide details on the daily losses at the company and said employees who lost their jobs were offered three months\\' pay as a severance. No other social media platform comes close to Twitter as a place where public agencies and other vital service providers â€” election boards, police departments, utilities, schools and news outlets â€” keep people reliably informed. Many fear Muskâ€™s layoffs will gut it and render it lawless. Roth said the companyâ€™s front-line moderation staff was the group the least impacted by the job cuts. He added that Twitterâ€™s â€œefforts on election integrity â€” including harmful misinformation that can suppress the vote and combatting state-backed information operations â€” remain a top priority.â€� Musk, meanwhile, tweeted that â€œTwitterâ€™s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.â€� But a Twitter employee who spoke with The Associated Press Friday said it will be a lot harder to get that work done starting next week after losing so many colleagues. â€œThis will impact our ability to provide support for elections, definitely,â€� said the employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concerns for job security. The employee said thereâ€™s no â€œconcrete sense of directionâ€� except for what Musk says publicly on Twitter. â€œI follow his tweets and they affect how we prioritize our work,â€� said the employee. â€œItâ€™s a very healthy indicator of what to prioritize.â€� Several employees who tweeted about losing their jobs said Twitter eliminated their entire teams, including one focused on human rights and global conflicts, another checking Twitterâ€™s algorithms for bias in how tweets get amplified, and an engineering team devoted to making the social platform more accessible for people with disabilities. Eddie Perez, a Twitter civic integrity team manager who quit in September, said he fears the layoffs so close to the midterms could allow disinformation to â€œspread like wildfireâ€� during the post-election vote-counting period in particular. â€œI have a hard time believing that it doesnâ€™t have a material impact on their ability to manage the amount of disinformation out there,â€� he said, adding that there simply may not be enough employees to beat it back. Twitterâ€™s employees have been expecting layoffs since Musk took the helm. He fired top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, and removed the company\\'s board of directors on his first day as owner. As the emailed notices went out, many Twitter employees took to the platform to express support for each other â€” often simply tweeting blue heart emojis to signify its blue bird logo â€” and salute emojis in replies to each other. A Twitter manager said many employees found out they had been laid off when they could no longer log into the companyâ€™s systems. The manager said the way the layoffs were conducted showed a â€œlack of care and thoughtfulness.â€� The manager, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of concerns for job security, said managers were not given any notice about who would be getting laid off. â€œFor me as a manager, itâ€™s been excruciating because I had to find out about what my team was going to look like through tweets and through texting and calling people,â€� the employee said. â€œThatâ€™s a really hard way to care for your people. And managers at Twitter care a lot about their people.â€� A coalition of civil rights groups escalated their calls Friday for brands to pause advertising buys on the platform. The layoffs are particularly dangerous ahead of the elections, the groups warned, and for transgender users and other groups facing violence inspired by hate speech that proliferates online. In a tweet Friday, Musk blamed activists for what he described as a â€œmassive drop in revenueâ€� since he took over Twitter late last week. Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said there is â€œlittle Musk can say to appease advertisers when heâ€™s keeping the company in a constant state of uncertainty and turmoil, and appears indifferent to Twitter employees and the law.â€� â€œMusk needs advertisers more than they need him,â€� she said. â€œPulling ads from Twitter is a quick and painless decision for most brands.â€� A lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of one employee who was laid off and three others who were locked out of their work accounts. It alleges Twitter violated the law by not providing the required notice. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification statute requires employers with at least 100 workers to disclose layoffs involving 500 or more employees, regardless of whether a company is publicly traded or privately held, as Twitter is now. The layoffs affected Twitter\\'s offices around the world. In the United Kingdom, it would be required by law to give employees notice, said Emma Bartlett, a partner specializing in employment and partnership law at CM Murray LLP. The speed of the layoffs could also open Musk and Twitter up to discrimination claims if it turns out, for instance, that they disproportionally affected women, people of color or older workers. ORIGINAL 12:10 p.m. Twitter began widespread layoffs Friday as new owner Elon Musk overhauls the social platform . The company had told employees by email that they would find out by 9 a.m. PDT (noon EDT) if they had been laid off. The email did not say how many of the roughly 7,500 employees would lose their jobs. Musk didnâ€™t confirm or correct investor Ron Baron at a conference in New York on Friday when he asked the billionaire Tesla CEO how much money he would save after he â€œfired half of Twitter.â€� Musk, speaking at Baronâ€™s annual investment conference, responded by talking about Twitterâ€™s ongoing cost and revenue challenges and blamed activists who this week called on big companies to halt advertising on the platform. Musk hasn\\'t commented on the layoffs themselves. â€œThe activist groups have been successful in causing a massive drop in Twitter advertising revenue, and weâ€™ve done our absolute best to appease them and nothing is working,â€� Musk said. Some employees of the San Francisco-based company tweeted earlier that they had already lost access to their work accounts. They and others tweeted messages of support using the hashtag #OneTeam. The email to staff said job reductions were â€œnecessary to ensure the companyâ€™s success moving forward.â€� Twitterâ€™s employees have been expecting layoffs since Musk took the helm of the company. Already, he has fired top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal , on his first day as Twitterâ€™s owner. Musk also had removed the companyâ€™s board of directors and installed himself as the sole board member. On Thursday night, many Twitter employees took to the platform to express support for each other -- often simply tweeting blue heart emojis to signify Twitterâ€™s blue bird logo -- and salute emojis in replies to each other. As of Friday, Musk and Twitter had given no public notice of the coming layoffs, according to a spokesperson for Californiaâ€™s Employment Development Department. Thatâ€™s even though the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification statute requires employers with at least 100 workers to disclose layoffs involving 500 or more employees, regardless of whether a company is publicly traded or privately held. A class action lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of one employee who was laid off and three others who were locked out of their work accounts. It alleges that Twitter intends to lay off more employees and has violated the law by not providing the required notice. The layoffs come at a tough time for social media companies, as advertisers are scaling back and newcomers -- mainly TikTok -- are threatening the older platforms like Twitter and Facebook. In a tweet Friday while employees were learning if theyâ€™d lost their jobs, Musk blamed activists for what he described as a â€œmassive drop in revenueâ€� since he took over Twitter late last week. He did not say how much revenue had dropped. Big companies including General Motors, General Mills and Audi have all paused ads on Twitter due to questions about how it will operate under Musk . Volkswagen Group said Friday it is recommending its brands, which include Skoda, Seat, Cupra, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche and Ducati, pause paid activities until Twitter issues revised brand safety guidelines. Musk has tried to appease advertisers, but they remain concerned about whether content moderation will remain as stringent and whether staying on Twitter might tarnish their brands. In his tweet blaming activists for a drop in revenue, Musk said â€œnothing has changed with content moderation.â€� Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said there is â€œlittle Musk can say to appease advertisers when heâ€™s keeping the company in a constant state of uncertainty and turmoil, and appears indifferent to Twitter employees and the law.â€� â€œMusk needs advertisers more than they need him,â€� she said. â€œPulling ads from Twitter is a quick and painless decision for most brands.â€�\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-05 01:44:00\",\"image_url\":\"https://www.castanet.net/content/2022/11/20221104121128-63653e449bb8c23fc5592833jpeg_p3633450.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"castanet\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Labor lawyer sheds insight into massive Twitter layoffs\",\"link\":\"https://www.wfaa.com/article/money/business/austin-labor-lawyer-sheds-insight-into-twitter-layoffs/269-a3d42e16-bf4c-435d-aa77-01866c326e9e\",\"keywords\":[\"business\",\"economy\",\"money\"],\"creator\":null,\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"Reports state that 50% of the workforce was laid off on Friday.\",\"content\":\"AUSTIN, Texas â€” Thousands of Twitter employees from around the country were laid off Friday after Elon Musk took over as the new owner. \\\\\"Really sad day for families across the country and families in Austin with folks working at Twitter.

SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images The news that a reported 3,700 Twitter TWTR employees were let go via email, was no surprise. However, it does call into question how badly advertising revenue will be hit as ad agencies try and figure out what the new Twitter will look like sans almost half of their employees. Employees likely didnâ€™t sleep well after getting an email on Thursday night telling them they would be notified what their future employment status was by 9:00 a.m. PST on Friday by email with the header â€œYour Role At Twitter.â€� It would be sent to their personal accounts if they are being let go, or to their work accounts if they would be staying, they were notified in an unsigned email. The company shut all offices on Friday â€œto help ensure the safety of each employee as well as Twitter systems and customer data.â€� Some employees who had been sleeping in their offices due to heavy time demands from Musk were shocked as they were escorted out of the building. Many employees got early warnings as their access to work platforms was shut off at about 8:00 p.m. and their email accounts were turned off at 11:00 p.m. \\\\\"It\\'s a break-up by text,\\\\\" a person affected by the layoffs said. \\\\\"My entire team is gone,\\\\\" one person impacted by the layoffs in New York told a reporter. They worked on a team of more than 30. Another employee estimated that 90% of their team was gone. Most of the management of the ad sales team, including Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland, VP of Global Client Solutions Jean-Phillipe Maheu and Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette, had already been let go by Chief Twit Elon Musk, who has been trying to placate advertisers by doing in-person and video meetings.

Russiaâ€™s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine Three of the worst hit teams were product and engineering for advertising, Redbird (the infrastructure team that runs data centers), and corporate communications. Muskâ€™s strategy to butter up advertisers has clearly not worked. General Mills GIS Inc., snack food manufacturer Mondalez International Inc., Pfizer PFE Inc. and Volkswagen AGâ€™s Audi are joining a growing list of companies â€œpausingâ€� campaigns on Twitter, according to The Wall Street Journal. One ad agency executive told The Journal that about 20 of its clients are no longer advertising on Twitter, and thatâ€™s just one agency. Musk himself gave a clue as to how bad things are when he tweeted that the company has had a massive drop in ad revenue since he acquired it a week ago. He said it was â€œdue to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.â€� He added, â€œExtremely messed up! Theyâ€™re trying to destroy free speech in America.â€� What he failed to consider is the fact that, like stock market investors, the thing that advertisers like the least is uncertainty. If they donâ€™t know exactly where and when their ad is being placed, and more importantly, what the demographic will be, they will simply stop their campaigns. Another issue is the mood of the remaining employees given Musk has no hesitancy in quickly letting people go if they donâ€™t carry out his vision. Many employees being laid off under the plan which has been dubbed â€œProject Tundra,â€� are being given only 60 days of severance pay. Twitter Chief Accounting Officer Robert Kaiden left the company after the list of layoffs was solidified, one of the last remaining Twitter execs to leave the company. Musk may in fact be losing even more employees than those he has laid off. Morale is likely to plummet with the massive layoffs paired with the fact that everyone working at home is being required to return to the office. Axios reports that employees are being given as little as 60 days to relocate to a Twitter office. This is a complete reversal of company policy that employees can work remotely on a permanent basis, and many took this opportunity to move somewhere cheaper and are unlikely to sell their homes and try and relocate to a much more expensive location such as San Francisco. Surprisingly, Twitter did not take down a flurry of tweets from prominent California Attorney Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) late Thursday night including: Â· Hey Twitter employees getting laid off tomorrow! IMPORTANT INFO from a CA employment attorney (me): CAâ€™s â€œWARNâ€� law requires Twitter to give you 60 days notice of a massive layoffs. A layoff of 50+ employees within a 30 day period qualifies. I know you didnâ€™t get that notice; Â· This WARN law applies to all California employers of 75+ employees, which obviously includes Twitter with its thousands of employees. Purpose of the law is to give laid off employeeâ€™s time to figure out how to handle this disruption. And Elon completely ignores it; Â· Twitter will be liable for all of these (civil penalties, lost compensation, lost medical and other benefits) & attorneyâ€™s fees for 60 days it failed to give workers notice. This flagrant violation of workerâ€™s rights is outrageous. Whoâ€™s in for a class action? LETâ€™S DO THIS; Â· Also, CAâ€™s strong antidiscrimination laws apply to Twitterâ€™s big layoff tomorrow. Are people of color, women and/or older workers disproportionately chosen for example? This was done so hastily, so slapdash, so that the worldâ€™s richest man gen get even richer faster; Â· Employees laid off in violation of the WARN Act receive back pay at the employeeâ€™s final rate or a 3 year average of compensation, whichever is higher. Twitter would also be liable for workersâ€™ medical expenses that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan; Â· Twitter employees, DO NOT SIGN IGN ANYTHING when youâ€™re laid off. Consult with an attorney first. Buried in the fine print may be a waiver of your rights under CA and Federal law. Those employers like Twitter who violate the WARN Act face civil penalties of $500/day for each violation. With thousands of employees this could be significant, though maybe not to Elon; and Â· Weâ€™ll see how long Twitter lets my posts stay up. If they take them down tonight, before the layoffs, that means they were on notice of the law I cite and chose to punish me rather than follow it. Thatâ€™s consciousness of guilt and Iâ€™d use it as the basis for punitive damages. A class action lawsuit was indeed filed against Twitter for not giving enough notice to employees prior to the layoffs by Shannon Liss-Riordan, who unsuccessfully sued Tesla in June of 2022 when the company cut about 10% of their workforce. However, Musk apparently has already thought this through by keeping people on the payroll who are laid off. The New York Times received an email from a worker who was notified that her job had been â€œimpactedâ€� but that they would stay employed through a separation date in February. â€œDuring this time, you will be on a Non-Working Notice period and your access to Twitter systems will be deactivated,â€� read the email, which was signed â€œTwitter.â€� Derek Baine Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-05 00:45:08\",\"image_url\":\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6258518fae172b6b4a4f6c41/0x0.jpg?width=960\",\"source_id\":\"forbes\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Twitter Is Elon Muskâ€™s Biggest Testâ€”and Teslaâ€™s Biggest Challenge.

In a statement to NBC News, Omnicom, the world\\'s second-largest agency by revenue, said that even as it remained in close contact with Twitter to determine any changes in the site\\'s operations, \\\\\"uncertainty of this kind raises concerns among advertisers.\\\\\" The company said it would continue to provide guidance to clients so they can make informed decisions. Meanwhile, a source familiar with the thinking of Interpublic Group\\'s Mediabrand advertising agency unit said it had advised its clients to halt spending on Twitter for at least one week to assess any new changes in the site\\'s direction. A spokesperson for Interpublic declined to comment. Musk confirmed the impact of the pullback in a tweet Friday, saying â€œTwitter has had a massive drop in revenue,\\\\\" and blaming what he called \\\\\"activist groups\\\\\" who he said were \\\\\"pressuring advertisers.\\\\\" He added: \\\\\"Extremely messed up! Theyâ€™re trying to destroy free speech in America.â€� There is no evidence that the advertisers are responding en masse to activist groups, and Musk\\'s own tweet was later given additional context by users who linked to news articles that suggested advertisers were acting independently. On Friday, a group comprised of 60 civil rights and civil society groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, launched the website, StopToxicTwitter.com, urging major brands to halt advertising on Twitter. As of this writing, there was not yet evidence that the companies or advertising groups had acted in response to that campaign. It is not clear what, if any, changes Musk and his team have made to the platform since he closed on his $44 billion deal to take the company private last week, though at least one study suggested hate speech on the platform increased soon after the takeover . Musk himself posted, then deleted , a debunked, anti-LGBTQ conspiracy theory about the attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just days after the deal closed. When asked how brands will position themselves in this opening chapter of Twitter\\'s new era, Wedbush Securities managing director, Dan Ives, told NBC News that advertisers simply do not want to be associated with controversy. \\\\\"If it becomes an essential street fight around hate speech, advertisers are going to run for the hills,\\\\\" Ives said. \\\\\"That fundamentally is the problem. Youâ€™re trying to bring advertisers back on while loosening content moderation. Those go exactly against each other. And no advertiser is going to jump in the deep end until they know the rules of the game. And Musk goes to the beat of a different drummer.\\\\\"\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-04 23:33:23\",\"image_url\":\"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/rockcms/2022-11/221104-twitter-office-mjf-1623-dff1b4.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"nbcnews\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Why Is Tesla Stock Dropping?

Employees are bracing for widespread layoffs at Twitter as Musk overhauls the social platform. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) Twitter began widespread layoffs Friday as new owner Elon Musk overhauls the social platform . The company had told employees by email that they would find out by 9 a.m. PDT (noon EDT) if they had been laid off. The email did not say how many of the roughly 7,500 employees would lose their jobs. Musk didnâ€™t confirm or correct investor Ron Baron at a conference in New York on Friday when he asked the billionaire Tesla CEO how much money he would save after he â€œfired half of Twitter.â€� Musk, speaking at Baronâ€™s annual investment conference, responded by talking about Twitterâ€™s ongoing cost and revenue challenges and blamed activists who this week called on big companies to halt advertising on the platform. Musk hasn\\'t commented on the layoffs themselves. â€œThe activist groups have been successful in causing a massive drop in Twitter advertising revenue, and weâ€™ve done our absolute best to appease them and nothing is working,â€� Musk said. Some employees of the San Francisco-based company tweeted earlier that they had already lost access to their work accounts. They and others tweeted messages of support using the hashtag #OneTeam. The email to staff said job reductions were â€œnecessary to ensure the companyâ€™s success moving forward.â€� Twitterâ€™s employees have been expecting layoffs since Musk took the helm of the company. Already, he has fired top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal , on his first day as Twitterâ€™s owner. Musk also had removed the companyâ€™s board of directors and installed himself as the sole board member. On Thursday night, many Twitter employees took to the platform to express support for each other -- often simply tweeting blue heart emojis to signify Twitterâ€™s blue bird logo -- and salute emojis in replies to each other. As of Friday, Musk and Twitter had given no public notice of the coming layoffs, according to a spokesperson for Californiaâ€™s Employment Development Department. Thatâ€™s even though the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification statute requires employers with at least 100 workers to disclose layoffs involving 500 or more employees, regardless of whether a company is publicly traded or privately held. A class action lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of one employee who was laid off and three others who were locked out of their work accounts. It alleges that Twitter intends to lay off more employees and has violated the law by not providing the required notice. The layoffs come at a tough time for social media companies, as advertisers are scaling back and newcomers -- mainly TikTok -- are threatening the older platforms like Twitter and Facebook. In a tweet Friday while employees were learning if theyâ€™d lost their jobs, Musk blamed activists for what he described as a â€œmassive drop in revenueâ€� since he took over Twitter late last week. He did not say how much revenue had dropped. Big companies including General Motors, General Mills and Audi have all paused ads on Twitter due to questions about how it will operate under Musk . Volkswagen Group said Friday it is recommending its brands, which include Skoda, Seat, Cupra, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche and Ducati, pause paid activities until Twitter issues revised brand safety guidelines. Musk has tried to appease advertisers, but they remain concerned about whether content moderation will remain as stringent and whether staying on Twitter might tarnish their brands. In his tweet blaming activists for a drop in revenue, Musk said â€œnothing has changed with content moderation.â€� Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said there is â€œlittle Musk can say to appease advertisers when heâ€™s keeping the company in a constant state of uncertainty and turmoil, and appears indifferent to Twitter employees and the law.â€� â€œMusk needs advertisers more than they need him,â€� she said. â€œPulling ads from Twitter is a quick and painless decision for most brands.â€�\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-04 19:11:00\",\"image_url\":\"https://www.castanet.net/content/2022/11/20221104121128-63653e449bb8c23fc5592833jpeg_p3633450.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"castanet\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Former employees sue Twitter over layoff, alleging violation of labor laws\",\"link\":\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-11-04/former-employees-twitter-layoff-lawsuits\",\"keywords\":null,\"creator\":[\"Samantha Masunaga\"],\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"The lawsuit alleges Twitter did not provide employees with adequate written notice ahead of a layoff that reportedly will eliminate 50% of Twitter\\'s jobs.\",\"content\":\"Former Twitter employees have sued the social media giant, alleging that the company violated and planned to violate federal and state laws that govern mass layoffs. The lawsuit comes as a large fraction of Twitterâ€™s employee base has been receiving layoff notices in the wake of Elon Muskâ€™s $44-billion acquisition of the company. The company said Thursday that all employees would be notified of their employment status by 9 a.m. Friday. Musk reportedly plans to lay off about 50% of the companyâ€™s 7,500-person workforce. Already, Musk has fired Twitterâ€™s executive leadership team, including now-former Chief Executive Parag Agrawal. Business Elon Musk reportedly plans to lay off as much as 50% of Twitterâ€™s workforce, with cuts announced Friday in an effort to lessen the debt Twitter took on. The lawsuit, which is seeking class action status, was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. Plaintiff Emmanuel Cornet was laid off from Twitter on Tuesday â€œeffective immediatelyâ€� without receiving a 60-day advance notice, which is required by the federal and state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act in the event of a mass layoff, according to the lawsuit. He also did not receive severance pay, the lawsuit said. Two days later, plaintiffs Justine De Caires, Jessica Pan and Grae Kindel were locked out of their company accounts, â€œwhich they understood to signal that they were being laid off,â€� according to the lawsuit. They, too, did not receive advance notice and were not formally notified of a layoff, the lawsuit said. The California Employment Development Department said Twitter has not filed any WARN notices signaling a mass layoff this year. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The plaintiffs are seeking to prevent Twitter from violating the federal and state WARN Act and from seeking releases of claims under those laws from laid-off employees without informing employees of the pendency of this lawsuit and their rights under those statutes.â€� The plaintiffs are also looking to be awarded damages, including all expenses and wages owed. The plaintiffsâ€™ attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, did not respond to a request for comment by The Times. On Friday, she told Bloomberg that Musk â€œis making an effort to complyâ€� with the law and that she was â€œpleasedâ€� to learn that at least some employees will keep getting paid until Jan. 4.\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-04 17:39:06\",\"image_url\":\"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8481d10/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5848x3891+0+0/resize/1500x998!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2Fa7%2F52114ea84bebbd66b4ec9170d0d4%2Ftwitter-89160.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"latimes\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Hereâ€™s How Social Media Giantsâ€”Including Twitter And Metaâ€”Are Bracing For Midterm Misinformation\",\"link\":\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/11/04/heres-how-social-media-giants-including-twitter-and-meta-are-bracing-for-midterm-misinformation/\",\"keywords\":[\"Business\",\"/business\",\"Business\",\"/business\",\"Breaking\",\"breaking-news\"],\"creator\":[\"Siladitya Ray\",\" Forbes Staff\"],\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"Major social media platforms struggled to tackle false claims about the 2020 election results and the calls for violence that followed, including those promoted by the candidates themselves.\",\"content\":\"Breaking Business Hereâ€™s How Social Media Giantsâ€”Including Twitter And Metaâ€”Are Bracing For Midterm Misinformation Siladitya Ray Forbes Staff Covering breaking news and tech policy stories at Forbes.

Nov 4, 2022, 01:27pm EDT | Updated Nov 4, 2022, 01:31pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline All major social media platforms have outlined plans to tackle misinformation around the midterm election and its immediate aftermath, but questions will remain about their effectiveness and the ability of these platforms to adequately implement these measures after struggling to do so during the 2020 elections. Nearly all major social media platforms have outlined their plans to tackle the upcoming midterm ... [+] elections. Getty Images Key Facts Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has temporarily suspended all â€œpolitical, electoral and social issueâ€� ads from its platforms like it did during the 2020 election and says it will reject all ads that discourage people from voting or question the legitimacy of the electionsâ€” will also take down posts that promote voter suppression, including misinformation about polling dates, locations, timings and voter eligibility. TikTok says it has been labeling all content around the midterms with links to its â€œElection Centerâ€� page which the company says will offer users â€œauthoritative informationâ€� about the polls. The platform will take down any content pushing election misinformation, harassment of poll workers, hateful behavior, and violent extremism and any content which is in the process of being fact checked by its partners will not be recommended on userâ€™s â€˜For Youâ€™ feed. Twitter says it plans to get ahead of misinformation on the platform using â€œprebunksâ€� which are prompts that appear on a userâ€™s timeline that â€œproactively address topics that may be the subject of misinformation.â€� Like it did in 2020, Twitter says it will continue to use labels on tweets sharing election-related misinformation, claiming that these help both direct people toward debunking content while reducing engagement levels for these tweets. Both YouTube and its parent Google will rely on the Associated Press to display â€œauthoritative election resultsâ€� on their platforms, while YouTube will also elevate content from â€œauthoritative news sourcesâ€� like â€œ CNN and Fox News ,â€� limit the spread of â€œharmful election misinformationâ€� and add information panels on top of all election related search results. What To Watch For All eyes will be on Twitter after it was recently acquired by billionaire and self-styled â€œfree speech absolutistâ€� Elon Musk. While Twitter continues to have policies in place to deal with election misinformation, there have been concerns about its ability to enforce these policies as it is set to lose nearly half of its workforce in a mass layoff on Friday. Earlier this week, Twitterâ€™s Head of Safety and Integrity Yoel Roth acknowledged that the platform had seen a brief surge in hateful content after being acquired by Musk, but attributed most of these issues to a small number of troll accounts. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that most members of Twitterâ€™s Trust and Safety team have been restricted from accessing the platformâ€™s internal moderation tools. In addition to this, Twitterâ€™s new owner, Elon Musk, faced criticism over the weekend after he tweeted out an unfounded conspiracy theory about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosiâ€™s husband. Musk, who has engaged in a war of words with progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), responded to a clip of the congresswoman accusing Musk of restricting her Twitter account by writing â€œWhat can I say? It was a naked abuse of power.â€� Key Background All the policies outlined by the major social media platforms largely seem to build upon measures that were in place for the 2020 elections. While most of these policies were enacted as outlined, there were several questions about the effectiveness of the use of labels and fact checks by â€œauthoritative sources.â€� Immediately after the 2020 election, all platforms had to scramble to deal with former President Donald Trumpâ€™s refusal to concede and various conspiracy theories shared by him and his supporters about the legitimacy of the election process. The proliferation of these false claims, led by the former president, came to a head when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on January 6, resulting in the former president being banned from all major social media platforms. Tangent It is unclear what kind of â€œauthoritative newsâ€� content YouTube plans to elevate but the choice of Fox News as one of the sources may raise some eyebrows as the network faces a $1.6 billion lawsuit from voting machine maker Dominion which has accused it of amplifying false claims about the voting machines being used to rig the 2020 elections.

His fansâ€”as well as those who believe the social media platform harbors a left-wing biasâ€”were delighted. But today, as part of an aggressive plan to trim costs that involves firing thousands of Twitter employees, Muskâ€™s management team cut a team of artificial intelligence researchers who were working toward making Twitterâ€™s algorithms more transparent and fair. Rumman Chowdhury , director of the ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability (METAâ€”no, not that one ) team at Twitter, tweeted that she had been let go as part of mass layoffs implemented by new managementâ€”although it hardly seemed that she was relishing the idea of working under Musk. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Chowdhury told WIRED earlier this week that the groupsâ€™ work was put on hold as a result of Muskâ€™s impending acquisition. â€œWe were told, in no uncertain terms, not to rock the boat,â€� she said. Chowdhury also said that her team had been doing some important new research on political bias that might have helped Twitter and other social networks from preventing particular viewpoints from being unfairly penalized. Joan Deitchman , a senior manager at Twitterâ€™s META unit confirmed that the entire team had been fired. Kristian Lum, formerly a machine learning reacher on the team, said the â€œentire META team minus oneâ€� had been let go. Nobody from the team, or Twitter, could be reached for comment this morning. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. As more and more problems with AI have surfaced, including biases around race, gender, and age, many tech companies have installed â€œethical AIâ€� teams ostensibly dedicated to identifying and mitigating such issues. Twitterâ€™s META unit was more progressive than most in publishing details of problems with the companyâ€™s AI systems, and in allowing outside researchers to probe its algorithms for new issues. Last year, after Twitter users noticed that a photo-cropping algorithm seemed to favor white faces when choosing how to trim images, Twitter took the unusual decision to let its META unit publish details of the bias it uncovered. The group also launched one of the first ever â€œbias bountyâ€� contests, which let outside researchers test the algorithm for other problems. Last October, Chowdhuryâ€™s team also published details of unintentional political bias on Twitter, showing how right-leaning news sources were, in fact, promoted more than left-leaning ones. Many outside researchers saw the layoffs as a blow, not just for Twitter but for efforts to improve AI. â€œWhat a tragedy,â€� Kate Starbird , an associate professor at the University of Washington who studies online disinformation, wrote on Twitter. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. â€œThe META team was one of the only good case studies of a tech company running an AI ethics group that interacts with the public and academia with substantial credibility,â€� says Ali Alkhatib , director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco. Alkhatib says Chowdhury is incredibly well thought of within the AI ethics community and her team did genuinely valuable work holding Big Tech to account. â€œThere arenâ€™t many corporate ethics teams worth taking seriously,â€� he says. â€œThis was one of the ones whose work I taught in classes.â€� Mark Riedl , a professor studying AI at Georgia Tech, says the algorithms that Twitter and other social media giants use have a huge impact on peopleâ€™s lives, and need to be studied. â€œWhether META had any impact inside Twitter is hard to discern from the outside, but the promise was there,â€� he says. Riedl adds that letting outsiders probe Twitterâ€™s algorithms was an important step toward more transparency and understanding of issues around AI. â€œThey were becoming a watchdog that could help the rest of us understand how AI was affecting us,â€� he says. â€œThe researchers at META had outstanding credentials with long histories of studying AI for social good.â€� As for Muskâ€™s idea of open-sourcing the Twitter algorithm, the reality would be far more complicated . There are many different algorithms that affect the way information is surfaced, and itâ€™s challenging to understand them without the real time data they are being fed in terms of tweets, views, and likes. The idea that there is one algorithm with explicit political leaning might oversimplify a system that can harbor more insidious biases and problems. Uncovering these is precisely the kind of work that Twitterâ€™s META group was doing. â€œThere arenâ€™t many groups that rigorously study their own algorithmsâ€™ biases and errors,â€� says Alkhatib at the University of San Francisco. â€œMETA did that.â€� And now, it doesnâ€™t.\",\"pubDate\":\"2022-11-04 16:20:36\",\"image_url\":\"https://media.wired.com/photos/6365367400aff92bacb21cde/master/pass/Musk_EthicalAI_twitter_biz_GettyImages-1395053069.jpg\",\"source_id\":\"wired\",\"country\":[\"united states of america\"],\"category\":[\"business\"],\"language\":\"english\"},{\"title\":\"Twitter layoffs hit Canadian office, involve at least two of the country\\'s top staff\",\"link\":\"https://www.castanet.net/news/Business/394498/Twitter-layoffs-hit-Canadian-office-involve-at-least-two-of-the-country-s-top-staff\",\"keywords\":null,\"creator\":[\"The Canadian Press\"],\"video_url\":null,\"description\":\"Global layoffs orchestrated by new Twitter owner Elon Musk have hit the company\\'s Canadian office with its two most senior leaders announcing they were part of the cuts.
